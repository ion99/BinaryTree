# Binary Search Tree 

A binary search tree is a tree in which data with lesser values are stored in left nodes and data with greater values is stored in right nodes. This characteristics provide for very efficient searches and holds for both numeric data and non-numeric data.

A binary search tree is made up of nodes, therefore we need to start with creating a Node object(class).
